; ==========================================
; Cost of stamina per frame while moving/climbing a surface.
; Higher = Tires faster while moving.
fStaminaCostMove = 0.300000

; Cost of stamina per frame while just hanging idle on a wall.
; Higher = Can't hang forever.
fStaminaCostIdle = 0.020000

; Multiplier for stamina cost when climbing with only ONE hand.
; 2.0 = Double cost (Harder to hang with one arm).
fStaminaOneHandCostMult = 2.000000

; Velocity threshold to consider "Moving" vs "Idle".
; If hand moves slower than this, it counts as Idle cost.

; ==========================================
; PHYSICS & FEEL
; ==========================================
; Global climbing speed/force multiplier.
; 1.0 = 1:1 movement. >1.0 = Super strength. <1.0 = Heavy feeling.
fForceMulti = 1.100000

; Maximum distance (in game units) from hand to wall to detect a grab surface.
; ~70 units is roughly arm's reach extending slightly from the controller.
fRayDist = 25.000000

; Maximum distance between hand and grab point before auto-release.
; Prevents "elastic arms" glitch.
fMaxArmLength = 120.000000

; Smoothing factor for the grab impact (0.0 - 1.0).
; Higher = Smoother grip catch, less jitter.
fGrabSmoothing = 0.150000

; Motion Smoothing (Low-Pass Filter) [0.0 - 1.0]
; Controls climbing responsiveness vs smoothness.
; 1.0 = Raw Input (Fastest response, most jitter/shaking).
; 0.1 = Heavy Filter (Very smooth, feels "laggy" or "heavy").
; Default 0.4 is a good balance for avoiding motion sickness.

; THROW / FLING MECHANICS
; ==========================================
; Multiplier for vertical velocity when throwing yourself up.

; You must move your hand down fast enough to reach this speed to fling.

; SAFETY & LIMITS
; ==========================================
; Absolute maximum physics velocity to prevent exploding through walls.
fMaxVelocity = 1500.000000

; Disable Fall Damage (Safety Mode)?
; 1 = Yes (Immortality). You take NO damage if you fall after climbing.
; 0 = No (Normal). Fall damage applies normally based on height if you let go.

; 0.2 = Very Weak
; 0.0 = Off

; Use VRIK Haptic System?
; 0 = No (Default) - Uses Vanilla system with Float precision (Better for weak vibrations).
; 1 = Yes - Uses VRIK's system (Integer only). Use this if Vanilla haptics don't work for your controller.
